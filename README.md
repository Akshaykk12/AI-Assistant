The AI voice assistant operates on a continuous loop, running in the background and awaiting user activation. Users initiate the voice assistant by speaking the activation command "HELIX," prompting the system to listen for their voice inputs. The program employs the speech recognition library to convert the user's spoken words into text form, enabling further processing and analysis.

To facilitate intelligent conversations, the project integrates ChatGPT, an AI model developed by OpenAI. ChatGPT utilizes natural language understanding and generation techniques to interpret user inputs and generate contextually relevant responses. By leveraging the power of machine learning and advanced language models, the voice assistant can comprehend and respond to a wide range of user queries, providing informative and helpful interactions.
To ensure a seamless user experience, the project incorporates the pyttsx3 library, which converts the generated responses back into voice format. This allows the voice assistant to deliver spoken responses to the users, making the interaction more natural and intuitive.
